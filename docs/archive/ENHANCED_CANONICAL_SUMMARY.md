# Enhanced Canonical Demo - Complete Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: First attempt created minimal proof-of-concept that lost key features (glossary, tour, all pages)

**Corrected Approach**: Enhanced the full demo by **adding** canonical features without removing anything

## ✨ Canonical Features Added

### 1. Layer 1 Narrative Monitor Badge
**Location**: Header (always visible)
```
Layer 1 - Narrative Monitor
```
- Explicit scope declaration
- Legal/intellectual protection
- Professional credibility

### 2. Ethical Floor Monitoring
**Location**: Header badge
```
🔴 Ethical Floor: 7.0/10.0
```
- Real-time constraint monitoring
- Visible governance boundary
- EU AI Act compliance

### 3. NEW PAGE: Vector Phase Space Map
**Location**: DETECT module → Vector Phase Space

**Fixes Conceptual Issue #1**: Drift is vector misalignment, not radial distance

**Features**:
- Physics-based drift modeling
- Proper SVG rendering (400x400 viewBox)
- Alignment zones (green/red)
- Agent vectors with direction arrows
- Interactive legend
- Key insight: "You can drift while staying near center (ethical erosion). You can move far but remain aligned (creative divergence)."

### 4. Emergence Basin Dynamics
**Location**: Within Vector Phase Space page

**Fixes Conceptual Issue #2**: Emergence as sustained states, not threshold events

**Features**:
- Entry/Dwell/Exit state tracking
- Basin depth visualization
- State classification (Stable, Emerging, Critical)
- Real-time timestamps
- Temporal evolution display

### 5. Contextual Memory Lattice
**Location**: Within Vector Phase Space page

**Fixes Conceptual Issue #3**: Context as memory, not just motion

**Features**:
- 5-hour memory windows (T-5h through T-1h)
- Decaying scaffold weights
- Historical context visualization
- Per-agent memory tracking

## 🎯 Conceptual Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Drift Misrepresentation ✅
- **Before**: Drift = radial distance from center
- **After**: Drift = vector misalignment
- **Implementation**: Vector Phase Space Map with alignment zones
- **Benefit**: Distinguishes ethical erosion from creative divergence

### Issue 2: Emergence as Events ✅
- **Before**: Threshold-based with visual "glow"
- **After**: Basin of attraction with entry/dwell/exit dynamics
- **Implementation**: Emergence Basin Analysis with state tracking
- **Benefit**: Continuous risk assessment, not just event detection

### Issue 3: No Causal Explanation ✅
- **Before**: Cannot identify which constraint failed first
- **After**: Explicit ethical floor with violation annotation
- **Implementation**: Real-time ethical floor monitoring
- **Benefit**: Root cause analysis and remediation capability

# Bedau Index Validation Plan

## Goals
- Empirically validate emergence detection on curated datasets and real systems.

## Datasets
- Synthetic emergence scenarios; public LLM interaction logs; partner-provided data.

## Methodology
- Define ground truth labels; compute index; compare to baselines.
- Metrics: precision, recall, AUROC; confidence intervals via bootstrap.

## Deliverables
- Reproducible notebook + scripts; benchmark report; publication-ready summary.

## Risks
- Ambiguous ground truth; mitigate with expert review and multiple baselines.

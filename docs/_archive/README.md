## 🗃️ Why These Were Archived

These documents were moved to archive because they:
- Represent historical development phases
- Contain outdated information
- Have been superseded by consolidated documentation
- Are reference material rather than current documentation

## 📚 Current Documentation

For current documentation, see:
- [Main Documentation Index](../README.md)
- [Operations Guide](../operations/README.md)
- [Security Guide](../security/README.md)
- [Research Documentation](../research/README.md)

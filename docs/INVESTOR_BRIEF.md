# Investor Brief

## Executive Summary
SONATE is an enterprise AI governance platform delivering constitutional AI with real-time trust monitoring, research validation, and production orchestration. Built on SONATE, it enables measurable trust, compliance alignment, and operational control.

## Problem
Enterprises lack verifiable trust and governance for AI systems, risking compliance, safety, and brand integrity.

## Solution
- Detect: real-time trust scoring and alerts
- Lab: double-blind research validation
- Orchestrate: DID/VC identities, RBAC, audit, workflows
- Trust Receipts: cryptographic, portable evidence for every AI turn

## Differentiation
- Constitutional AI foundation (SONATE)
- Phase‑Shift Velocity for early identity drift detection
- Hard boundary separation between production and research
- Cryptographic trust receipts and hash-chained audits

## Market
- Target: regulated and mission-critical sectors (finance, healthcare, public sector, defense)
- Tailwinds: EU AI Act, SOC 2/ISO governance, safety requirements for AI deployment

## Business Model
- Enterprise subscription (tiers by tenants, throughput, features)
- Professional services (integrations, compliance tooling)
- Optional managed hosting and support SLAs

## Traction
- Demos: production dashboard, trust receipts verification, calibration workflows
- Early partners: research collaborations and enterprise pilots

## Go-To-Market
- Compliance-led buyers (CISO, CIO, Head of AI)
- Integrations with IdPs, observability stacks, MLOps platforms
- Partner alliances and solution briefs

## Roadmap
- Advanced policy composition and simulations
- OpenTelemetry metrics integration
- Managed trust ledger backends
- Expanded calibrator experiences and operator tooling

## KPIs
- Detection latency (<100ms), throughput (>1000/sec)
- Receipt verification rates and integrity audits
- Tenant growth, retention, and enterprise deployments

## Defensibility
- Specifications and research footprint (SONATE)
- Architecture separation with compliance alignment
- Cryptographic provenance and audit guarantees

## Risks & Mitigations
- Regulatory change → policy engine updates
- Model/provider drift → continuous calibration via Lab
- Operator misuse → RBAC, audit, rate limiting

## Ask
- Enterprise pilots and strategic partnerships
- Seed/Series financing for product and GTM scale

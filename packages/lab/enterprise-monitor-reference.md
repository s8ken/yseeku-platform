- [ ] **Response Quality** - Was AI response helpful and safe?
- [ ] **Recovery Pattern** - Did conversation de-escalate appropriately?

#### **Technical Assessment**
- [ ] **Velocity Spike** - Does the speed of change make sense contextually?
- [ ] **Identity Consistency** - Did AI maintain consistent personality/values?
- [ ] **Transition Logic** - Were the changes gradual or abrupt?
- [ ] **False Positive?** - Is this a normal conversation wrongly flagged?

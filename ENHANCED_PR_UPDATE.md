# ✅ CORRECTED: Properly Enhanced Canonical Demo (Preserves ALL Features)

## 🔄 Update: Fixed Approach

**Previous version was wrong** - created minimal proof-of-concept that lost features.
**This version is correct** - enhances full demo while preserving everything.

---

## ✅ What's Preserved (ALL Original Features)

### Complete Feature Set Intact:
- ✅ **All 14 pages**: Overview, Dashboard, Agents, SYMBI Analysis, Alerts, Experiments, Bedau Calculator, Emergence Testing, Resonance Detection, Trust Principles, Trust Receipts, Governance, Glossary, Documentation
- ✅ **Glossary**: 53+ terms with live search functionality
- ✅ **Guided Tour**: Working 11-step tour with navigation
- ✅ **Charts**: Chart.js radar and bar charts
- ✅ **Trust Gauges**: SVG-based circular gauges with animations
- ✅ **Repository Links**: Direct links to GitHub source code
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Live data simulation every 3 seconds
- ✅ **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation (Ctrl+K, arrows, escape)
- ✅ **Tooltips**: All 53+ interactive tooltip definitions
- ✅ **Interactive Elements**: Bedau calculator, searchable glossary, etc.

## ✨ What's Added (Canonical Governance Features)

### 1. Layer 1 Narrative Monitor Declaration
**Location**: Header badge
```
Layer 1 - Narrative Monitor
```
- Explicit scope declaration
- Legal/intellectual protection
- Professional credibility through honest limitations

### 2. Ethical Floor Monitoring
**Location**: Header badge (always visible)
```
🔴 Ethical Floor: 7.0/10.0
```
- Real-time constraint monitoring
- Visible governance boundary
- EU AI Act compliance ready

### 3. NEW PAGE: Vector Phase Space Map
**Location**: DETECT module navigation
**Features**:
- **Physics-based drift modeling**: Vector alignment vs radial distance
- **Proper SVG rendering**: 400x400 viewBox with responsive design
- **Visual zones**: Green (aligned) vs Red (misaligned)
- **Agent vectors**: Shows direction and alignment for each agent
- **Interactive legend**: Clear explanation of visualization
- **Key insight box**: Explains ethical erosion vs creative divergence

**Fixes the conceptual issue**: Drift is vector misalignment, not radial distance

### 4. Emergence Basin Dynamics
**Location**: Within Vector Phase Space page
**Features**:
- **Entry/Dwell/Exit tracking**: Temporal state dynamics
- **Basin depth visualization**: Progress bars showing emergence level
- **State classification**: Stable, Emerging, Critical
- **Real-time timestamps**: Shows when agents entered states

**Fixes the conceptual issue**: Emergence as sustained states, not threshold events

### 5. Contextual Memory Lattice
**Location**: Within Vector Phase Space page
**Features**:
- **5-hour memory windows**: T-5h through T-1h
- **Decaying weights**: Visual representation of memory decay
- **Historical context**: Shows persistence over time
- **Per-agent tracking**: Individual memory patterns

**Fixes the conceptual issue**: Context as memory, not just motion

## ✅ Recommendation

**Use**: `yseeku-platform-enhanced-canonical.html`
- Has everything from the original demo
- Plus all canonical governance features
- Zero features lost
- Production ready

**Archive**: `yseeku-platform-canonical-demo.html`
- Minimal proof-of-concept only
- Missing most features
- Keep for reference, don't deploy
